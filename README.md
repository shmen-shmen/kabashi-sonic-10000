# KABASHI SONIC 10000

A simple synth made with Web Audio API. Press keys like that: AWSEDRF... to make sounds. You can also use sliders to add effects and record your tunes to listen to them later. Sometimes a guest pays you a visit.

App based on a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ1Pnjr9zvi4x9sofuSjF6fcjjRT222In) by [Thomas Foydel](https://github.com/thomasfoydel).
