# KABASHI SONIC 10000

This is a synthesizer. Press keys like that: AWSEDRF to make sounds. 

Pull all the sliders and all the toggles and menus it will figure itself out and start to sound cool eventually. That's how all synths work.

When you like what you hear â€“ press REC button and save your tune for personal enjoyment and sharing purposes.

At some point a guest will pay you a visit.

Enjoy!
